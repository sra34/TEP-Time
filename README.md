# TEP-Time

This repository has R code and associated data files for analysis of TEP over time and is associated with the following submitted manuscript:

**TEP over time: assessing the temporal variability and drivers of transparent exopolymer particles in a subtropical estuary**<br/>
*Elizabeth L. Harvey, Sean R. Anderson, Quintin Diou-Cass, and Patrick I. Duffy (2020)*<br/>

R code involves scripts for creating heatmaps to show Spearman correlation values between TEP and environmental factors and scatter plots of specific relationships from the temporal dataset.
